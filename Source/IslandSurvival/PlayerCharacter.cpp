/*
	frame rate dependance is when the speed of a character etc changes based on the frame rate of the game as the tick function gets called once every frame
	frame rate independence is when the speed of a character etc remains the same regardless of the frame rate of the game

	why no delta time with movement
	2. The value from the keyboard already includes delta time within it so it would work independently of the frame rate automatically

	why no delta time for mouse input
	3. The value comming in from the mouse is a delta value of how much it has changed since the previous frame so * by detlaTime is not needed
	this link should help https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/1000423/how-to-get-framerate-independent-pawn-rotation.html?sort=oldest
	it is polling/ sampling every frame and the values are determined by the difference in position of the mouse per frame
	controllers however are not frame rate independent so require it to be added
